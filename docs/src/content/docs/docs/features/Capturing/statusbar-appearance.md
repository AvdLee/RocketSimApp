RocketSim allows you to customize the status bar of the iOS Simulator.

## 9:41

You might or might not have noticed, but all of Apple’s devices have the status bar time set to 09:41. Here’s an image from the iPhone product page as an example:

[That time used to be 9:42](https://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-ad-942-2012-2), matching the time of January 9th, 2007 when Steve Jobs announced the first first iPhone. Around 42 minutes into his keynote he mentioned:

> “Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.”
> 

Quite the historic sentence for us developers!

With RocketSim, you can apply the same appearance using the 09:41 button:

## Configuring a custom status bar appearance

In some cases, you want to go more extreme. You can use the Custom status bar configuration sheet to create a status bar that matches your preference.

For example, a low battery level and 3G network connection:
